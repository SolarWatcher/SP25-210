## Assignment 3: Looping The DOM

### Key Takeaways

I learned how to properly use the js systems and DOM systems to alter my HTML and add things into them through the js script. I did 1:1 of what the assingment asked of me, creating the first page and having a for loop sort it into an unordered list. For the second page creating that and then creating a secondary for loop to find the average of all the numbers. Finally for the last page I created a for loop to assign images and properly give them alt tags and limit their height.
