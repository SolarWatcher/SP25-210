### Version Control, Git, & GitHub

Version control is using Git and GitHub to see and control the version of the code you have. Git is a thing used to help upload things directly from VSCode to GitHub and is used to help share code. GitHub is used to share your code in an easier and store it incase your code is affected in a way you dont like you can refresh from the GitHub, or replace it with newer code as needed. Basically a way to store versions of your code.

### Markdown & Documentation

Markdown is a language used to format plain text to HTML a lot easier and can be used to format things like headings, bold, italics, lists, links, etc. Makes it easier to share documentation without needing to do all the HTML tags. Many platforms like GitHub which we are using support Markdown to make it easier to share simply because it's easier to use than HTML.
