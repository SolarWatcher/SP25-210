## Assignment 2: Blog

### Blog Topic Summary

Just over my personal obession with bunnies, not the most accurate blog but just things I wanted to share and speak about!

### Key Takeaways

I used a mixture of the styles.css and html to create the page, I was having some weird bugs were I was unable to properly center stuff but fixed it with a weird workaround using grids to force things into the center and leaving the side grids blank, It's scuffed but it works out in the end I don't know why it was so difficult to format it how I wanted it to be. I also gave everything a border and background color because I felt it made it feel more lively than a blank white page (ewh). Mainly just used the techniques we had been learning and toyed around with borders until I got one I liked.
