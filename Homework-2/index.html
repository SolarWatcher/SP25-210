        This is a blog about Bunnies!!! Yep, That it is. Very much so. What else
        did you think it would be about? I have an ongoing obession with Bunnies
        that has lasts several years now (Can't have a bunny since I have a cat
        and a dog love them to pieces but makes it hard to have a small evil
        fluffy bunny). However I still love these little critters all the same.
        I decided on Bunnies since I thought it would be fun to ramble about and
        make a scuffed website on!

        "Rabbits are small mammals in the family Leporidae, which is in the
        order Lagomorpha. They are familiar throughout the world as a small
        herbivore, a prey animal, a domesticated form of livestock, and a pet,
        having a widespread effect on ecologies and cultures." -Wikipedia
        However this doesn't cover everything about them! They are just small
        little critters who are mostly herbivores expect for the one in monty
        python and the holy grail. There are also Giant Bunnies called Flemish
        Giants I shall show one in the next section below!!

        Bunnies can live up to 12 years, This also applies to the Flemish
        Giants, Oddly enough baby bunnies are called kittens, They can turn
        their ears 180 degrees and have nearly 360 degree vision. Carrots are
        actually very bad for them and should only be given as treats (it's
        basically candy to them), And finally they are just critters, just
        little silly creatures.
