## Field Trip Project

### Project Summary

My project would be over western art and the paintings and statues created about it. I would take the paintings and set it up in an art gallery format where you could explore the different paintings and look at them.
However if you clicked on a painting you would dive into it and get a deeper exploration to the history and artist behind it. As for the statues you could have them come to life in their display and move around, causing the history to be presented as they show it to you.

### Core Webpages

I would say the website would have one core web page that allows you to click around it and look at all the different paintings and statues. As you clicked on a painting you would dive into it, which would take you to a seperate web page with more information on the history and artist as well as bringing you inside the painting making it feel like you were there in the art being depicted. These would also allow you to exit out of the painting back into the gallery to explore the other paintings and their history. For the statues they would move around in their displays and present the information to you, this could still be on the same webpage. and the text would fade away if you swapped to another statue or painting.

### Design Choices

Not a website but super mario 64 is heavy inspiration for the diving into paintings, where it could be like that going from to page. For the colors the main hall I would have be light greys, dark greys, and medium grey colors, very plain and very dull. This way so when you dive into a painting it would suddenly be comfortable with the colors of the painting. The colors of the painting would vary from painting to painting, matching the color pallet for the pages. For the statues they would be dull at first and then when they are brough to life they fill their display with colors in an enviorment that they would of been in. For the paintings and statues I would also have some of the color bleed out into the dull room to bring life to it, so once you've explored the history of everything in the room it will be fully colorful again.

The data that would need to be recorded for this is what pages and what statues you would have to interact with to save that you have interacted with them. This would also apply for the color bleeding out into the room as it would need to store that you have interacted with the painting or statue so the color stays on the page for you.

Basically take some of these websites listed here and make them into an actual art gallery
