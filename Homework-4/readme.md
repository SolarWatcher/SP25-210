## Assignment 3: Choose Your Adventure Story

### Story Summary

A story where your trapped in an underground sandstone ruins. Your goal is to escape with your life or die trying. There are three paths to choose. Each one has a way to leave. Only one path lets you truly leave.

### Key Takeaways

I set up a basic index.html file to house the adventure in, giving IDs to everything I wished to alter with DOM manipluation later as well as creating basic CSS for the file to begin with. Upon going into the JS script I had it begin your adventure and have DOM manipluation change the page's colors to better fit the underground theming. The text will change colors based on what door you pick/what ending you get. All death endings I marked in red and all winning endings I marked in neon green. Otherwise it's a lot of for loops and if else statements within eachother to decide every option. Every single option is handeled this way to not allow you to go back and change your choices and also to check what choice you made. I could of optimized it better but I set it up in the best way I could. I also research how to change a button to act as a link for href to reset the page if you wanted to once the adventure had started.
